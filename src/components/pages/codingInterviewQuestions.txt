// We need to call the constructor and super to use "this.state" and and to bind the initial state with
	// "this.setState" to change that initial value(this.state)

    

        // axios is used here to communicate with the API to grab the items from devcamp.space, using withCredentials
				// to verify the authorized user

                // then is used to receive the items after getting a "response" from calling the API

                // catch is used to "catch" any errors if there are any from our request.

                // still researching componentDidMount and lifecycle methods, keep researching until makes sense.

                {/* so data is a prop passed into PortfolioSidebarList. It takes in the initial state(this.state) of 
                    portfolioItems and populates it when we call get portfolioItems using axios and we pass that 
                    to props(data)   */}

Coding Interview Questions
What is Synthetic Event? 
Has to do with the DOM (Document Model Object) which exists on a normal HTML webpage. Then there's a virtual DOM
that exists only in React, since React technically doesn't work with the normal DOM. The virtual DOM creates these
Synthetic Events in place of normal Events from a regular HTML page...
